					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Minnesota Lynx are an American professional basketball team based
              in Minneapolis, Minnesota, playing in the Western Conference in the
              Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team won the WNBA
              title in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017.</p>

            <p>Founded prior to the 1999 season, the team is owned by Glen Taylor,
              who is also the majority owner of the Lynx' NBA counterpart, the
              Minnesota Timberwolves. The franchise has been home to many high-quality
              players such as Katie Smith, explosive small forward Seimone Augustus,
              native Minnesotan Lindsay Whalen, UConn standout Maya Moore, forward
              Rebekkah Brunson, and center Sylvia Fowles.</p>

            <p>The Lynx have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in twelve of their
              twenty-one years. With four championships, the Lynx are tied with
              the Houston Comets and the Seattle Storm for the most titles in WNBA
              history, and they have won more Western Conference championships
              than any other franchise. They currently hold a WNBA record ten
              consecutive playoff appearances.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>On April 22, 1998, the WNBA announced they would add two expansion
                teams (Minnesota and the Orlando Miracle) for the 1999 season.
                The team was officially named the Minnesota Lynx on December 5,
                1998. The Lynx started their inaugural season in 1999 with 12,122
                fans in attendance to watch the first regular-season game against
                the Detroit Shock at Target Center. The Lynx defeated Detroit 68–51
                in the franchise's first game. They finished their first season 15–17
                overall and held the same record in 2000.</p>

              <p>The 2005 season was one of transition for the franchise. Leading
                scorer Katie Smith was dealt to Detroit in July and the team stumbled
                down the stretch, missing the playoffs for the first time in three years.
                The poor finish did pay off however, as the team won the draft lottery
                and selected All-American guard Seimone Augustus of Louisiana State
                University with the first overall pick in the 2006 WNBA Draft. The
                Lynx began the 2006 season as the youngest team in the WNBA. On May
                31, the team set the WNBA single-game scoring record (at the time),
                routing the Los Angeles Sparks by a score of 114–71. Despite this
                victory and with her team floundering to an 8–15 record, head coach
                McConnell-Serio resigned on July 23. She was replaced by assistant
                Carolyn Jenkins, who piloted the squad to a 2–9 finish. The team's
                24 losses set a franchise record.</p>

							 <p>The Lynx earned the top overall seed in the 2011 WNBA Playoffs.
                 In the first round, they defeated the San Antonio Silver Stars
                 two-games-to-one in the best of three series. The Lynx then swept
                 the Phoenix Mercury in two games to win their first conference
                 championship. In the Finals, the Lynx trailed at halftime in each
                 game, but rallied each time to sweep the Atlanta Dream in three games,
                 securing their first WNBA title, and the first professional championship
                 for the state of Minnesota since the Minnesota Twins won the World
                 Series in 1991. Seimone Augustus was named Finals MVP.</p>

                <p>In 2015, two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sylvia Fowles of
                  the Chicago Sky held out of her contract until her wish was granted
                  in July to play for Minnesota. The Lynx would go on to win their
                  third franchise title, all three of them in a five-year span dating
                  back to 2011. Fowles proved herself to be a crucial addition, earning
                  finals MVP honors.</p>

                <p>After winning the WNBA title in 2015, the Lynx qualified to the
                  2016 WNBA Playoffs as the top seed with a franchise record 28–6
                  finish, only entering in the semifinals to face the Phoenix Mercury.
                  Due to the Target Center entering a renovation, the team moved to
                  the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, where the Lynx played the
                  2017 regular season.[19] A sweep of the Mercury qualified the Lynx
                  for their fifth finals in six years, with the adversary being the
                  Los Angeles Sparks. The Lynx would not repeat their title, as the
                  Sparks edged out the Lynx in a five-game series, eventually winning
                  game 5 by 1 point.</p>

                <p>On August 12, 2017, the Lynx set two WNBA records in their 111–52
                  defeat of the Indiana Fever: largest margin of victory (59 points)
                  and longest unanswered scoring run (37 consecutive points). The
                  Lynx finished as the top seed in the league, finishing 27–7. In
                  the semi-finals, the Lynx defeated the Washington Mystics in a
                  three-game sweep to advance to the WNBA Finals for the sixth time
                  in seven years. The Lynx avenged 2016's Finals loss to the Sparks
                  by defeating them in five games to win their fourth championship
                  in seven seasons and tying the now-defunct Houston Comets for most
                  WNBA championship titles.</p>

                <p>In 2018, with back-up point guard Renee Montgomery leaving in
                  free agency to sign with the Atlanta Dream and a now aging roster
                  intact, the Lynx would start falling way short of championship
                  contention. Although Moore, Fowles, Augustus and Brunson made
                  All-Star appearances, the Lynx finished as the number 7 seed in
                  the league with an 18–16 record. This was the first time in 8 years
                  where the Lynx did not finish as a top 2 seed. Lindsay Whalen also
                  announced her retirement prior to the playoffs. The Lynx started
                  off their playoff run against the rival Los Angeles Sparks in the
                  first round elimination game. They lost 75–68, ending their run
                  of three consecutive Finals appearances, and it was Whalen's final
                  career game. In 2019 and 2020, however, the Lynx would continue
                  to produce players who would win WNBA Rookie of the Year.</p>
