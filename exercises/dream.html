					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Atlanta Dream are an American professional basketball team based
              in Atlanta, Georgia, playing in the Eastern Conference in the Women's
              National Basketball Associatiob (WNBA). The team was founded for the
              2008 WNBA season. The team is owned by Dream Too LLC, which is composed
              of two Atlanta businesswomen: Mary Brock and U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler.
              Although the Dream share the Atlanta market with the National Basketball
              Association's Hawks, the Dream is not affiliated with their NBA counterpart.
              The Dream play at the Gateway Center Arena in College Park, Georgia.</p>

              <p>The Dream has qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in nine of its 12
                years in Atlanta and has reached the WNBA Finals three times. The
                franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as University
                of Louisville standouts Angel McCoughtry and Shoni Schimmel, former
                Finals MVP Betty Lennox, and Brazilian sharpshooter Izi Castro Marques.
                In 2010, the Dream went to the WNBA Finals but fell short to Seattle.
                They lost to the Minnesota Lynx in the 2011 and 2013 WNBA Finals. </p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>Even before the success of the United States women's basketball
                team in the 1996 Olympic Games, the American Basketball League had
                interest in placing a women's professional basketball team in Atlanta
                as early as 1995. Eight of the twelve Olympians played on ABL teams
                when the league began play in October 1996. The Atlanta Glory played
                at Forbes Arena and lasted two seasons before folding before the
                start of the 1998–99 season, which would be the ABL's final. </p>

              <p>Atlanta had been mentioned as a possible future city for WNBA expansion,
                but efforts did not come together until the beginning of 2007 when
                an organizing committee with Atlanta businessmen and politicians
                began the effort to attract an expansion team. The inability of
                the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA to draw crowds was a concern of the
                WNBA, and the committee kicked off an effort in February 2007 to
                gain volunteers and petition signatures. Philips Arena (now State
                Farm Arena), the Gwinnett Arena (now Infinite Energy Arena) and
                Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now McCamish Pavilion) were candidates
                for venues. By May 2007, the committee had over 1,000 pledges for
                season tickets, although the goal was 8,000 season tickets in
                ninety days. By July the committee had 1,200 commitments and began
                searching for an owner.</p>

							 <p>On October 16, 2007, it was reported that Ron Terwilliger, an
                 Atlanta businessman and CEO of a national real estate company would
                 be the future owner of an Atlanta franchise. The next day, at a news
                 conference at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, WNBA president
                 Donna Orender made the announcement that Atlanta would officially
                 be granted a WNBA expansion franchise.</p>

                <p>On November 27, 2007, Atlanta named Marynell Meadors, a coach
                  with extensive experience at the college level, the first head
                  coach and general manager in franchise history. This was Meadors'
                  second role as a coach/general manager in the WNBA following a
                  stint with the Charlotte Sting. Afterwards, Meadors had served
                  as a scouting director for the Miami Sol and had been an assistant
                  coach under Richie Adubato and Tree Rollins for the Washington Mystics.
                  Former NBA player Dennis Rodman volunteered his name as head coach
                  for the Dream. Terwilliger declined, stating that he wanted someone
                  with more coaching experience and he felt that the head coach should
                  be a woman, as the WNBA was a women's league.</p>

                <p>Atlanta held their expansion draft on February 6, 2008 when they
                  selected one player from each of the 13 teams in the league. Atlanta
                  traded Roneeka Hodges and their number four pick in the 2008 WNBA
                  Draft to the Seattle Storm for Izi Castro Marques and Seattle's
                  eighth pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. Also, the Dream traded the 18th
                  pick and LaToya Thomas to the Detroit Shock for Ivory Latta.</p>

                <p>On October 18, 2019, the Dream unveiled an updated logo and color
                  scheme, the first change to their branding since the team's inception
                  in 2008.</p>
