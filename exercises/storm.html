					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Seattle Storm are an American professional basketball team based
              in Seattle, Washington, playing in the Western Conference of the Women's
              National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team was founded by Ginger
              Ackerley and her husband Barry ahead of the 2000 season. The team is
              currently owned by Force 10 Hoops LLC, which is composed of three
              Seattle businesswomen: Dawn Trudeau, Lisa Brummel, and Ginny Gilder.</p>

            <p>The Storm have qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in twelve of its
              seventeen years in Seattle. The franchise has been home to many
              high-quality players such as former UConn stars Sue Bird, Swin Cash,
              and Breanna Stewart; 2004 Finals MVP Betty Lennox; and Australian
              power forward Lauren Jackson, a three-time league MVP. The Storm are
              four-time WNBA Champions, with victories in 2004, 2010, 2018, and 2020.
              They are one of two teams who have never lost a WNBA Finals, the
              defunct Houston Comets being the other.</p>

            <p>The team cultivates a fan-friendly, family environment at home games
              by having an all-kid dance squad, which leads young fans in a conga
              line on the court during time-outs, to the music of "C'mon N' Ride
              It (The Train)" by the Quad City DJ's. Named for the rainy weather
              of Seattle, the team uses many weather-related icons: the team mascot
              is Doppler, a maroon-furred creature with a cup anemometer on its head;
              the theme song for Storm home games is AC/DC's "Thunderstruck"; and
              its newsletter is called Stormwatch. The Storm were the sister team
              of the Seattle SuperSonics of the NBA prior to February 28, 2008, when
              the team was sold to Force 10 Hoops LLC.</p<

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>The Storm's predecessor was the Seattle Reign, a charter member
                of the American Basketball League (ABL), operating from 1996 through
                December 1998, when the league folded. Luckier than most localities
                that had an ABL team, Seattle was quickly awarded a WNBA franchise
                and began to play less than two years later. The Seattle Storm would
                tip off their first season (the 2000 WNBA season) in typical expansion
                fashion. Coached by Lin Dunn and led by guard Edna Campbell and Czech
                center Kamila Vodichkova, the team finished with a 6–26 record. The
                low record, however, allowed the Storm to draft a 19-year-old Australian
                standout Lauren Jackson. Though Seattle did not make the playoffs
                in the 2001 season, Jackson's impressive rookie performance provided
                a solid foundation for the franchise to build on.</p>

              <p>In the 2002 draft, the Storm drafted UConn star Sue Bird, filling
                the Storm's gap at the point guard position. With Bird's playmaking
                ability and Jackson's scoring and rebounding, the team made the
                playoffs for the first time in 2002 but were swept by the Los Angeles
                Sparks. Coach Anne Donovan was hired for the 2003 campaign. In Donovan's
                first year, Jackson would win the WNBA Most Valuable Player Award, but
                the team had a disappointing season (with Bird injured for much of
                the year), and the Storm missed the playoffs. The 2004 Storm posted
                a then franchise-best 20–14 record. In the playoffs, the Storm made
                quick work of the Minnesota Lynx, sweeping them in the first round.
                The Storm then squared off against an up-and-coming Sacramento Monarchs
                team in the West Finals. The Storm would emerge victorious, winning
                the series 2–1. In the WNBA Finals, the Storm would finish off the
                season as champions, defeating the Connecticut Sun 2 games to 1.
                Betty Lennox was named MVP of the Finals. The win made Anne Donovan
                the first female head coach in WNBA history to win the WNBA Championship.</p>

						  <p>In the 2010 season, the Storm was almost unstoppable with a record-tying
                28 wins and 6 losses in the regular season, including a perfect 17–0
                at KeyArena. This was the most home wins in the history of the WNBA.
                Along the way, Lauren Jackson was named WNBA Western Conference Player
                of the Week five times, and Western Conference Player of the Month
                three times, on her way to being named WNBA MVP for the third time.
                Agler was also named Coach of the Year. In the playoffs, the Storm
                dramatically reversed their fortunes from the previous five seasons.
                They started with a sweep of the Sparks, the team that previously
                knocked them out of the playoffs every time they met. Then they
                swept Diana Taurasi and the Phoenix Mercury in the conference finals,
                and the Atlanta Dream in the WNBA Finals. With two league championships,
                the Storm became Seattle's most successful pro sports team by that measure.</p>

              <p>After having the worst record in the WNBA, the Storm ended up with
                the first overall pick again using it to select Breanna Stewart from
                the University of Connecticut. In the 2016 WNBA season, Stewart immediately
                emerged as one of the young rising stars in the league, winning Rookie
                of the Year, averaged an impressive 18.9 ppg and broke the record
                for most defensive rebounds in a regular season. Loyd would statistically
                improve, averaging 16.5 ppg, birthing a new, young dynamic tandem as
                the "Next Great Storm Duo" after Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson. This
                would lead the Storm back into playoff contention as they finished
                as the 6th seed with a 16-18 record under the league's new playoff
                format, but would lose to the Atlanta Dream in the first round
                elimination game.</p>

              <p>In the 2017 season, both Loyd and Stewart continued to get better
                and lead the Storm into playoff contention. Loyd averaged 17.7 ppg
                and Stewart 19.9 ppg. Stewart would become an all-star for the first
                time in her career and was one of two all-stars representing the
                Storm in the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game along with Sue Bird. The Storm
                finished as the 8th seed with a 15-19 record but would lose yet
                again in the first round elimination game by the Phoenix Mercury.</p>

              <p>In the 2018 season, the Storm would elevate from a mediocre playoff
                team to a title contender. In the offseason, they made some slight
                changes to the roster. They traded for Natasha Howard and drafted
                Jordin Canada. Bird, Loyd, and Stewart were all voted into the 2018
                WNBA All-Star Game, creating a "big three" on the Storm's roster.
                Bird also broke records in 2018 by becoming the franchise leader
                in scoring and the league's all-time regular-season assists leader.
                With Bird's leadership and the continued development of Loyd and
                Stewart, the Storm finished 26-8 with the number 1 seed headed into
                the WNBA Playoffs. They would receive a double-bye to the semi-finals.
                Stewart who averaged 20.0 ppg and 8.8 RPG won the 2018 Most Valuable
                Player award. They faced the Phoenix Mercury in the semi-finals where
                Stewart averaged 24.0 ppg and Loyd added 11.0 ppg. They would defeat
                the Mercury in a hard-fought five-game series, advancing to the WNBA
                Finals for the first time since 2010. In the Finals, the Storm would
                sweep their opponent, the Washington Mystics, winning their first
                championship in eight years, Stewart was named Finals MVP.</p>

              <p>Even before the season started, 2019 was a year defined by health
                issues for the Storm. On April 15, Stewart ruptured her Achilles
                tendon playing in a Euroleague game for Dynamo Kursk when she collided
                with Brittany Griner, putting her out for the entire 2019 season.
                Four days later, head coach Dan Hughes was diagnosed with a cancerous
                tumor in his colon; he had it removed in May and missed the entire
                season, with assistant Gary Kloppenburg taking over in an interim
                role Later that month, after the Storm finished their preseason
                schedule, it was announced that Bird would have to undergo knee
                surgery, sidelining her too for the year.</p>

              <p>With Bird out, Canada stepped into the starting point guard role,
                finishing 2019 third in the WNBA in assists per game (5.5) and
                second in steals per game (2.3). Meanwhile, without Stewart an with
                Loyd missing seven games with an injury of her own, Howard became
                the focal point of the Seattle offense, scoring a career-high 18.1
                points per game. The shorthanded Storm finished the season 18-16,
                earning the No. 6 seed in the 2019 WNBA playoffs. Seattle won its
                first-round matchup against the Minnesota Lynx, 84-74, and then
                lost in the second round to the Los Angeles Sparks, 92-69.</p>

              <p>The 2020 WNBA season was atypical, played entirely inside Bradenton,
                Florida's IMG Academy, dubbed the "wubble," the WNBA's version of
                the NBA's Bubble. The Storm entered the wubble with Bird and Stewart
                back, but without head coach Dan Hughes, whose cancer diagnosis made
                him a health risk. Bird missed several games with a left knee bone
                bruise, but came back for the playoffs, in which the Storm didn't
                lose a single game. The Storm closed out the top-ranked Las Vegas
                Aces in three games en route to their fourth championship, with
                Stewart again named Finals MVP.</p>
