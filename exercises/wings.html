					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Dallas Wings are an American basketball team based in Arlington,
              Texas. The Wings play in the Western Conference in the Women's National
              Basketball Association (WNBA). The team is owned by a group which is
              led by Chairman Bill Cameron. Greg Bibb is President and CEO. Brad
              Hilsabeck joined the Dallas Wings ownership group in March 2019 with
              the acquisition of Mark Yancey’s interest in the Wings.</p>

              <p>The team was founded in Auburn Hills, Michigan, before the 1998
                WNBA season began and moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, before the 2010
                season; on July 20, 2015, Cameron announced that the franchise
                would move to Arlington for the 2016 WNBA season.</p>

              <p>The franchise has been home to players such as shooting guard Deanna
                Nolan, one of women's basketball's all-time leading scorers Katie
                Smith, Cheryl Ford, Skylar Diggins-Smith, Odyssey Sims, and Australian
                center Liz Cambage.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>The Shock were one of the first WNBA expansion teams and began
                play in 1998. The Shock quickly brought in a blend of rookies and
                veterans, but only qualified for the postseason once in its first
                five years of existence. The Shock went through two coaches (hall
                of famer Nancy Lieberman and Greg Williams) before hiring former
                Detroit Pistons legend Bill Laimbeer. There were rumors the Shock
                would fold after the team's awful 2002 season. Laimbeer convinced
                the owners to keep the team for another year, certain that he could
                turn things around. The Shock would finish the next season with a
                25–9 record and defeated the two-time defending champion Los Angeles
                Sparks in the 2003 WNBA Finals. Detroit became the first team in
                league history to go from last place one season to WNBA champions
                the next season. After a couple seasons of losing in the first round
                of the playoffs, the Detroit Shock returned to success and would
                appear in three straight Finals from 2006 to 2008. They won WNBA
                championship in 2006 over the Sacramento Monarchs and 2008 over
                the San Antonio Silver Stars, but lost to the Phoenix Mercury in 2007.</p>

              <p>Tulsa had been mentioned as a possible future city for WNBA expansion,
                but efforts did not come together until the middle of 2009. An organizing
                committee with Tulsa businesspeople and politicians began the effort
                to attract an expansion team. The group was originally given a September
                1 deadline, however, WNBA President Donna Orender extended that deadline
                into October. The investment group hired former University of Arkansas
                head coach Nolan Richardson as the potential franchise general manager
                and head coach, and on October 15, 2009, the group made its official
                request to join the league. On October 20, 2009, WNBA President
                Donna Orender, lead investors Bill Cameron and David Box, Tulsa mayor
                Kathy Taylor, Oklahoma governor Brad Henry, and head coach Nolan
                Richardson were present for a press conference announcing that the
                Detroit Shock would relocate to Tulsa. On January 23, 2010, the
                franchise announced that the team would remain as the Shock but
                the colors were changed to black, red, and gold. On July 20, 2015,
                majority owner Bill Cameron announced he was moving the team to
                Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>

							<p>On July 23, 2015, WNBA League owners unanimously approved the
                Tulsa Shock's relocation to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to play
                out of the College Park Center at the University of Texas at Arlington.
                College Park Center is also home to the UT Arlington Mavericks basketball
                and volleyball teams. At a press conference at College Park Center
                on November 2, 2015, it was announced that the team was renamed the
                Dallas Wings.</p>
