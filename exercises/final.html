					<p>The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a professional
						basketball league in the United States. It is currently composed of
						twelve teams. The league was founded on April 22, 1996, as the women's
						"Counterpart" to the National Basketball Association (NBA), and league
						play started in 1997. The regular season is played from May to September,
						with the "All Star" game being played midway through the season in July
						(except in Olympic years) and the WNBA Fianls at the end of September
						until the beginnng of October. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to hold
						a midseason tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, starting in the 2020 season
						were placed on hold. Initially, regular-season Cup games were to be played
						through early July, followed by a final match in August. The pandemic also
						led to the entire 2020 season being helo without fans at the IMG Academy in
						Bradenton, Floride.</p>

						<h2>History</h2>
							<p>The creation of the WNBA was officialy approved by the NBA Board of
							Governors on April 24, 1996, and announced at a press conference with
							Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, and Sheryl Swoopes in attendance. The new WNBA
							had to compete with the recently formed American Basketball League, another
							professional women's basketball league that began play in the fall of 1996
							but would cease operation during its 1998-99 season. </p>

							<p>The WNBA began with eight teams: the Charlotte Sting, Cleveland
							Rockers, Houston Comets, and New York Liberty in the Eastern Conference;
							and the Los Angeles Sparks, Phoenix Mercury, Sacramento Monarchs, and
							Utah Starzz in the Western Conference. </p>

							<p>On the heels of a much-publicized gold medal run by the 1996 USA BAsketball
							Women's National Team at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the WNBA began
							its first season on June 21, 1997 to little fanfare. The first WNBA game
							featured the New York Liberty facing the Los Angeles Sparks in Los Angeles.
							The game was televised nationally in the United States on the NBC television
							network. At the start of the 1997 season, the WNBA had television deals in
							place with NBC (NBA right holder), and the Walk Disney Company and Hearst
							Corporation joint venture channels, ESPN and Lifetime Television Network,
							respectively. Penny Tolor scored the league's first point.</p>
