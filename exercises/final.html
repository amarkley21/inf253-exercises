					<p>The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a professional
						basketball league in the United States. It is currently composed of
						twelve teams. The league was founded on April 22, 1996, as the women's
						"Counterpart" to the National Basketball Association (NBA), and league
						play started in 1997. The regular season is played from May to September,
						with the "All Star" game being played midway through the season in July
						(except in Olympic years) and the WNBA Fianls at the end of September
						until the beginnng of October. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to hold
						a midseason tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, starting in the 2020 season
						were placed on hold. Initially, regular-season Cup games were to be played
						through early July, followed by a final match in August. The pandemic also
						led to the entire 2020 season being helo without fans at the IMG Academy in
						Bradenton, Floride.</p>
