					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Los Angeles Sparks are an American professional basketball team
              based in Los Angeles, California, playing in the Western Conference
              in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team was
              founded before the league's inaugural 1997 season began. Like some other
              WNBA teams, the Sparks have the distinction of not being affiliated
              with an NBA counterpart, even though the market is shared with the
              Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers. As of 2019, the Sparks
              are the last franchise to win back-to-back titles. Lakers owner Jerry
              Buss owned the Sparks from 1997 to 2006 when Williams Group Holdings
              purchased the team. It was previously the sister team of the Los Angeles
              Lakers. As of 2014, the Sparks are owned by Sparks LA Sports, LLC.</p>

              <p>The Sparks have qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in sixteen of their
                twenty years in Los Angeles, more than any other team in the league.
                The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as 6
                foot 4 inch center Tennessee standout Candace Parker, flashy point
                guard Nikki Teasley, and nearby USC products Lisa Leslie and Tina
                Thompson. In 2001, 2002, 2003, 2016 and 2017, the Sparks went to
                the WNBA Finals. They won the title in 2001, 2002, and 2016, beating
                Charlotte, New York, and Minnesota respectively, but fell short to
                Detroit in 2003 and Minnesota in 2017. Being in a major national
                market, the Sparks have always been a focal point of the league;
                they faced New York in the league's inaugural game on June 21, 1997.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>The 1997 WNBA season, the league's first, opened with a game between
                the Sparks and the New York Liberty at the Sparks home (The Forum)
                in Inglewood. The Sparks lost the game 57–67. Sparks player Penny
                Toler scored the league's first two points with a lay-up 59 seconds
                into the game. The Sparks finished with a record of 14–14. The team
                did compete for a playoff spot, but because of a loss to the Phoenix
                Mercury in the final game of the season, the Sparks missed the playoffs.
                In the 1998 WNBA season, the Sparks finished 12–18, missing the
                playoffs once more.</p>

              <p>The 2000–01 off-season saw a move to the Staples Center and a coaching
                change, when the Sparks hired former Los Angeles Lakers player Michael
                Cooper as head coach. During the ensuing regular season, the Sparks
                again posted a 28–4 record. In the 2001 playoffs, the Sparks finally
                eliminated the Comets, sweeping them in the first round. The Sparks
                took all three games to eliminate the Monarchs to earn their first
                berth in the WNBA Finals, in which they swept the Charlotte Sting,
                2–0, for their first league championship. In 2002, Leslie became
                the first woman in the league to dunk the ball during a game, and
                once again the Sparks dominated the regular season, posting a 25–7
                record. The Sparks then flew through the playoffs, sweeping both the
                Seattle Storm and the Utah Starzz. In the finals, the Sparks were
                matched against the Liberty, who were still looking for their first
                championship. A late three-pointer in game 2 by Nikki Teasley gave
                the Sparks their second consecutive championship.</p>

							 <p>In 2003, the Sparks posted a 24–10 record and went into the playoffs
                 looking for a "three-peat". Both the first and the second rounds were
                 forced to deciding third games, as they beat the Minnesota Lynx and
                 Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks then faced the upstart Detroit Shock
                 in the Finals. The Shock were on a roll after having been the worst
                 team in the WNBA in 2002. The Finals were a battle fueled by the
                 relationship between head coaches Michael Cooper (Sparks) and Bill
                 Laimbeer (Shock) which stemmed from their days in the NBA. The rough
                 road to the finals and the tough play of the Shock wore down the Sparks,
                 who lost the series two games to one and failed to three-peat.</p>

                <p>During the 2003-04 off-season, the Sparks signed two players,
                  Tamika Whitmore and Teresa Weatherspoon, who had played for the
                  New York Liberty. When the season began, the Sparks got off to
                  a great start, but coach Cooper left at mid-season to seek a
                  coaching job in the NBA. The loss of their coach was a factor
                  in the team's so-so finish to the season, which ended with a
                  record of 25–9. During the playoffs, the team lost in three games
                  to the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks never recovered through
                  the 2005 season and finished with a 17–17 record. They barely
                  made the playoffs as the number-four seed. In the first round,
                  the Sparks were outplayed and swept by the eventual champion
                  Monarchs. In 2006, the Sparks played much better, posting a 25–9
                  record. In the playoffs, they defeated the Seattle Storm in three
                  games. However, in the Western Conference finals, the Sparks'
                  season was ended by the Monarchs for the third year in a row.</p>

                <p>After the 2006 season ended, team owner Jerry Buss, who also
                  owned the Lakers, announced he was selling the Sparks. On December
                  7, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported the sale to an investor
                  group led by Kathy Goodman and Carla Christofferson. Goodman is
                  currently a high school teacher at HighTech-LA in Lake Balboa and
                  was a former executive for Intermedia Films. Christofferson is a
                  litigation attorney for the O’Melveny & Myers law firm and was
                  Miss North Dakota USA in 1989. The day after the sale was announced,
                  team star Lisa Leslie announced that she was pregnant and would
                  not play in the WNBA in the 2007 season. The loss of Leslie for the
                  year proved devastating, as the Sparks posted a league-worst 10–24
                  record. The record was also the worst in Sparks history, as the
                  Sparks missed the playoffs for the first time since 1998.</p>

                <p>After making the playoffs in 2015, losing in the first round,
                  the Sparks made subtle roster changes and improved the following
                  year. Suddenly showing signs of championship contention, they
                  finished with a 26–8 record and made it to the 2016 WNBA Playoffs.
                  By this time, the Sparks had a "Big Three", consisting of Candace Parker,
                  Nneka Ogwumike and Kristi Toliver. They earned the number 2 seed
                  in the league and received a double bye to the semi-finals with
                  the WNBA's new playoff format. The Sparks faced off against the
                  Chicago Sky in the semi-finals and defeated the Sky 3 games to
                  1 to advance to the Finals for the first time since 2003. They
                  faced the number 1 seeded Minnesota Lynx in the finals. They stole
                  game 1 on the road when veteran forward Alana Beard made a game-winning
                  jumper at the buzzer, lifting the team to a 78–76 victory. They
                  lost game 2 79–60, but back in Los Angeles, put themselves one
                  win away from their first title in over a decade with a dominant
                  92–75 game 3 victory. Even though they expected to clinch a
                  championship on their home floor, they lost game 4 in a disappointing
                  finish of 85–79. Game 5 was truly historic, against all odds, and
                  swarmed with Minnesota fans, the 2016 WNBA MVP, Nneka Ogwumike
                  grabbed an offensive rebound and made the game-winning shot to
                  put the Sparks ahead 77–76 with 3.1 seconds remaining. The Sparks
                  won their first championship since 2002 and their third championship
                  in franchise history. Candace Parker was named the Finals MVP.</p>
