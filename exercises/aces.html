					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Las Vegas Aces are an American professional basketball team
              based in Las Vegas metropolitan area. The Aces compete in the Western
              Conference of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA),
              and play their home games at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</p>

            <p>The team was founded in Salt Lake City, Utah, as the Utah Starzz
              before the league's inaugural 1997 season. It then moved to San Antonio,
              Texas before the 2003 season and became the San Antonio Silver Stars,
              later shortened to the San Antonio Stars in 2014.[2] The team relocated
              to Las Vegas before the 2018 season. The team is owned by MGM Resorts
              International. They are the fourth WNBA franchise not to share a market
              with an existing NBA team, following the Seattle Storm (were founded in
              2000, when Seattle was also home to the NBA's SuperSonics), Connecticut
              Sun, and Tulsa Shock(Founded as the Detroit Shock 1998–2009, then became
              the Tulsa Shock 2010–2015. They are now the Dallas Wings (2016–present).
              Dallas is the home market of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks).</p>

            <p>As the Stars, the team qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in seven
              of their fourteen years in San Antonio. The franchise has been home
              to many high-quality players such as all-star point guard Becky Hammon,
              solid power-forward Sophia Young, former first-overall draft pick Ann
              Wauters, seven-foot-two-inch center Margo Dydek, two-time Sixth Woman
              of the Year Dearica Hamby, and 2020 league MVP A'ja Wilson. In 2008,
              the franchise went to the WNBA Finals but were swept by Detroit.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>One of the eight original WNBA teams, the Utah Starzz (partially
                named after the old ABA team, the Utah Stars, but with the zz at
                the end like the Utah Jazz) never met the same success as their
                (former) counterpart in the NBA, the Utah Jazz. They held the distinction
                of having the worst record in the WNBA in 1997 and were the first
                team to select in the 1998 WNBA Draft. With their selection, they
                picked 7 ft. 2 in. center Margo Dydek, who easily became the tallest
                player in WNBA history. Unfortunately, the pickup of Dydek did little
                to help their cause and they again finished near the bottom of the
                league in the 1998 & 1999 seasons. The Starzz finally posted a winning
                record in 2000, but did not make the playoffs. In 2001, the Utah
                Starzz made it to the playoffs for the first time, but they were
                quickly swept in the first round by the Sacramento Monarchs. In
                2002, the Starzz made it to the playoffs again, and this time beat
                the Houston Comets in the Western Conference Semifinals 2 games to 1.
                Their playoff run ended in the Western Finals, however, as they were
                swept aside by the eventual champs, the Los Angeles Sparks.</p>

              <p>When the NBA divested itself of all of its WNBA franchises at the
                end of the 2002 season, the Utah Jazz ownership did not wish to retain
                ownership of the Starzz. The Starzz then looked for local Utah potential
                buyers, but none were found, leaving the franchise with the choices
                of either being sold to out-of-town investor(s) or folding. The Starzz
                avoided folding when the franchise was sold to Peter Holt (the owner
                of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs) and relocated to San Antonio. The
                team's name was changed to the San Antonio Silver Stars and would
                change its team colors to the silver and black motif used by the Spurs.</p>

              <p>For the first four seasons (2003–2006) after moving to San Antonio,
                the franchise was unable to change its old losing trend and did not
                make the playoffs. The 2007 season brought a lot of change for the
                Silver Stars. They acquired stars Becky Hammon, Ruth Riley, and
                Sandora Irvin in trades, selected Helen Darling in Charlotte Sting's
                dispersal draft, drafted Camille Little in the second round, signed
                Erin Buescher during the off-season, and retained key players, such
                as Marie Ferdinand-Harris, Vickie Johnson, Shanna Crossley, Kendra
                Wecker, and Sophia Young. The new-look Silver Stars became an instant
                contender in the Western Conference. On August 4, 2007 the Silver
                Stars clinched their first playoff berth since the franchise relocated
                to San Antonio in 2003. In the first round, the Silver Stars were
                matched up against the Sacramento Monarchs. After losing game 1 in
                Sacramento, the Silver Stars would win games 2 and 3 to advance
                to the Western Finals. The Silver Stars faced off against a strong
                Phoenix Mercury team, which had the number 1 seed in the Western
                Conference. On September 1, 2007 the Silver Stars' season came to
                an end after the Stars lost Game 2 98–92 in Phoenix.</p>

              <p>Heading into 2008, the Silver Stars were regarded as a premiere
                contender and did not disappoint. After an average start, the Stars
                seized control of the Western Conference and rode to the best record
                in the West, and the #1 seed in the playoffs. In the WNBA Finals,
                the Silver Stars faced the Detroit Shock, who were making their
                third WNBA Finals appearance in a row. In Game 1 at home, the Silver
                Stars fell behind early, but would tie the game at 69 with 2:15 left
                in the 4th quarter. But from there the Shock took control once again
                and won the game 77–69. The 2010 season was not much different for
                the Stars. They finished with an unimpressive 14–20 record but sneaked
                into the third seed of the playoffs in a below-average Western Conference.
                The Silver Stars were swept in the first round of the playoffs by
                Phoenix and it was clear that some changes were needed. In the 2012
                playoffs, the Silver Stars lost in the first round to the Los Angeles
                Sparks. The team would miss the playoffs in 2013. In the 2014 playoffs,
                the Stars would lose in the first round to the Minnesota Lynx.</p>

							<p>After the Spurs Sports & Entertainment decided to put the team up
                for sale, following the 2017 season, it became apparent the team
                would be on the move. The NBA and WNBA approved the sale of the Stars
                to MGM Resorts on October 17, 2017, with the intention of relocating
                the team to Las Vegas and playing at the Mandalay Bay Events Center
                starting in the 2018 season. On December 11, 2017, at a press conference
                inside the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, the team name
                was officially announced as the Las Vegas Aces.[4] They received the
                first pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft, and picked South Carolina’s A’ja Wilson.</p>
