					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Washington Mystics are an American professional basketball team
              based in Washington, D.C. The Mystics compete in the Women's National
              Basketball Association (WNBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern
              Conference. The team was founded prior to the 1998 season, and is owned
              by Monumental Sports & Entertainment (led by Ted Leonsis), which also
              owns the Mystics' NBA counterpart, the Washington Wizards. Sheila C.
              Johnson, co-founder of BET and ex-wife of Charlotte Sting owner Robert
              L. Johnson, is the managing partner.</p>

              <p>The Mystics have qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in 10 of its 20
                seasons of existence, and the franchise has been home to such high-quality
                players as two-time WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne, Tennessee standout
                Chamique Holdsclaw, athletic shooting guard Alana Beard, and nearby
                Maryland product Crystal Langhorne. Until 2018, the Mystics were
                the only current WNBA franchise that had never made it to the WNBA
                Finals. They lost in the semifinals twice, to New York in 2002 and
                to the eventual champion Minnesota Lynx in 2017. After reaching the
                WNBA Finals for the first time in 2018, they won their first championship
                in 2019.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>The Washington Mystics were one of the first WNBA expansion franchises
                to be established. In 1998, their first season, they finished with
                a WNBA worst 3-27 record, despite being led by Olympian Nikki McCray.
                Although they did not make the playoffs that year, the team had high
                expectations after drafting University of Tennessee star Chamique
                Holdsclaw in 1999. Washington improved but again failed to make the
                playoffs as they finished with a 12–20 record. Holdsclaw would lead
                the team to the playoffs in 2000, making the playoffs with a record
                of 14–18, losing to the New York Liberty in a first-round sweep.</p>

              <p>After being tied for the worst record in the WNBA in 2001 with a
                10–22 record, coach Tom Maher and General Manager Melissa McFerrin
                both resigned. With the future of the franchise up in the air, Mystics
                assistant coach Marianne Stanley took over as head coach. With the
                duo of Holdsclaw and rookie guard Stacey Dales-Schuman, the Mystics
                made the playoffs in 2002 with a 17–15 record. They would sweep
                the Charlotte Sting in the first round, but lose to New York again
                in the Eastern Conference Finals 2 games to 1. This would be the
                only time the Mystics would win a playoff series until 2017.</p>

              <p>The 2005 season saw deep changes in the Mystics organization.
                Former star Holdsclaw joined the Los Angeles Sparks and the team
                was sold by Washington Sports and Entertainment to Lincoln Holdings
                LLC, led by Ted Leonsis. In 2005, the team finished the regular
                season with a record of 16–18 and failed to make the playoffs. In
                2006, the Mystics posted an 18–16 record thriving under star guard
                Alana Beard who was drafted in 2004. The Mystics entered the playoffs
                as the 4th seed. In the first round, Washington was ultimately swept
                by the Connecticut Sun, the first-seeded team in the East.</p>

							 <p>In 2008, the Mystics looked to build on their near-playoff appearance
                 in a tough Eastern Conference. They drafted Crystal Langhorne of
                 Maryland with the 6th pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. Plagues again
                 by coaches problems, the Mystics fell to the bottom of the East
                 again, finishing only in front of the expansion Atlanta team.
                 The Mystics had gone through 10 coaches in 11 years of existence,
                 the most in the WNBA. The Mystics front office knew it needed to
                 completely clean out the entire coaching and management staff.</p>

                <p>In the 2013 WNBA season, the Mystics were 17-17 and made the
                  playoffs losing in the first round.</p>

                <p>Prior to the 2014 WNBA season, the Mystics drafted Bria Hartley
                  and Stefanie Dolson in the 2014 WNBA Draft. In the 2014 WNBA season,
                  Meesseman became the starting center for the Mystics. They finished
                  16-18 and made the playoffs but lost in the first round yet again.
                  In the 2015 WNBA season the Mystics made a change in their starting
                  line-up by putting Dolson at center and Meesseman at power forward.
                  The Big-women duo would have breakout seasons as they both were
                  selected into the 2015 WNBA All-Star Game. Later on, in the season,
                  the Mystics finished 18-16 and made the playoffs, but were once
                  again a first-round exit. Going into the 2016 WNBA season, the
                  Mystics kept acquiring and developing young talent. They drafted
                  Kahleah Copper in the 2016 WNBA Draft and put Hill in the starting
                  line-up. Hill would have a breakout season, leading the Mystics
                  in scoring with a career-high 15.4 ppg and was second place in
                  voting for the WNBA Most Improved Player award. The Mystics would
                  unfortunately not make the playoffs, finishing with a disappointing
                  13–21 record but showed signs of promise in the future. Meesseman
                  continued to improve after her breakout season, averaging a career-high
                  15.2 ppg. Also on September 7, 2016, the Mystics scored a franchise
                  record of 118 points along with 16 three-pointers (another franchise
                  record) in a 118–81 victory over the Chicago Sky.</p>

                <p>During the 2016–17 off-season, the Mystics were busy in the trade
                  market. With enough trade assets, they were determined to make a
                  trade for a superstar player. First, on January 30, the team
                  executed a three-way deal with the New York Liberty and Seattle
                  Storm, sending Bria Hartley and Kia Vaughn to the Liberty and
                  receiving the Storm's #6 pick in the 2017 draft. This proved
                  the prelude to an even larger deal as it freed up cap space to
                  land a superstar on their team. Officially announced on February
                  2, the Mystics traded Kahleah Copper, Stefanie Dolson and the
                  second overall pick in the 2017 WNBA draft to the Chicago Sky in
                  exchange for 2015 league MVP Elena Delle Donne. Also during the
                  off-season in free agency they would sign three-point specialist
                  Kristi Toliver (who had just won a championship with the Los Angeles
                  Sparks in the previous season), upgrading their roster into a
                  championship contender. However, with Meesseman missing some
                  games due to overseas commitment, and Tayler Hill out with a torn
                  ACL midway through the season, the Mystics were the number 6 seed
                  in the league with an 18–16 record. The Mystics defeated the Dallas
                  Wings 86–76 in the first round elimination game. In the second
                  round elimination game, the Mystics defeated the New York Liberty
                  82–68, advancing past the second round for the first time in
                  franchise history, coming off a record-setting performance by
                  Toliver, as she drained 9 three-pointers in the win. In the semi-finals,
                  the Mystics were defeated by the Minnesota Lynx in a 3-game sweep,
                  who would go on to win the 2017 WNBA championship.</p>

                <p>In the 2018 WNBA season, the Mystics played without their starting
                  power forward Emma Meesseman, who played for Team Belgium in the
                  FIBA World Tournament. The Mystics made some adjustments in their
                  starting lineup to compensate for her absence. One month into
                  the season, Tayler Hill made her return to the team after recovering
                  from her ACL injury, but she was traded a month later to the Dallas
                  Wings in exchange for Aerial Powers. That trade helped the Mystics
                  boost their roster's wing depth. The Mystics finished as the #3
                  seed in the league with a 22–12 record, receiving a bye to the
                  second round. In the second-round elimination game, they defeated
                  the Los Angeles Sparks 96–64, advancing to the semifinals for the
                  second year in a row. In the semifinals, the Mystics defeated the
                  #2 seeded Atlanta Dream in an intense five-game series, advancing
                  to the WNBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. In
                  the finals, they were swept by the Seattle Storm.</p>

                <p>Meesseman returned in the 2019 WNBA season, and her return powered
                  the Mystics towards achieving an unprecedented regular season
                  record of 26–8, leading the entire league in total wins and
                  losses and earning them the top spot in the playoffs. With a dogged
                  determination to come back to the Finals and high hopes that a
                  Finals title would at last be within their grasp, the Mystics
                  began their playoff run skipping the two single-elimination rounds
                  to a semifinal series against the Las Vegas Aces, just more than
                  a year after Washington and Las Vegas's NHL teams, the Capitals
                  and the Golden Knights, competed in the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals
                  with the former emerging victorious. The Mystics held off the Aces
                  on the first two home games for an insurmountable 2–0 series lead,
                  before finishing them off in Game 4 after the Aces made a desperate
                  bid to extend the series with a Game 3 defeat. The Mystics then
                  returned to the Finals against the Connecticut Sun, a team that
                  had the second-best record in the regular season that was no less
                  hungry for a championship, having come a win short of one before.
                  This time, the Mystics prevailed through five intense games, by
                  winning the odd-numbered ones and losing the even-numbered ones,
                  with the availability and health of playoffs MVP Elena Delle Donne
                  becoming a crucial factor in the outcome. The Sun were able to tie
                  the series twice by exploiting Donne's early exit in Game 2 due
                  to a back injury, then drawing upon unrelenting resolve and willingness
                  to learn from mistakes after a Game 3 loss to deny the Mystics an
                  opportunity to close the series early on their home court. The
                  Mystics finally earned their first-ever championship by erasing
                  multiple deficits in the final tiebreaker game, before breaking
                  through in the crucial final quarter to hold on to an 89–78 victory.
                  Meesseman was honored as the Finals MVP.</p>
