					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Indiana Fever are an American professional basketball team based
              in Indianapolis, Indiana, playing in the Eastern Conference in the Women's
              National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team was founded before
              the inaugural 2000 season began. The team is owned by Herb Simon,
              who also owns the Fever's NBA counterpart, the Indiana Pacers, and
              Simon Malls.</p>

              <p>The Fever has qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in 13 of its 20 seasons
                in Indiana. Some of the players who have helped define the history
                of the Fever include the American players Tamika Catchings, Katie
                Douglas, and Tully Bevilaqua from Australia. In 2009, the Fever
                went to the WNBA Finals but fell short to Phoenix. On October 21,
                2012, the Fever won the WNBA Championship with a win over the Minnesota
                Lynx. Tamika Catchings was named the series MVP.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>The Indiana Fever team began in 2000, when the state was granted
                an expansion franchise to coincide with the opening of Bankers Life
                Fieldhouse (then Conseco Fieldhouse). In their first two seasons,
                they were coached by women's basketball legends Anne Donovan and
                Nell Fortner. Led by center Kara Wolters, in their inaugural campaign
                the team posted a record of 9–23. The Fever drafted University of
                Tennessee star Tamika Catchings in the 2001 WNBA Draft. The Fever
                went into the year with high expectations of a playoff berth, but
                Catchings tore her ACL during a college game and missed the entire
                WNBA season. The Fever posted a 10–22 record in 2001. After missing
                the entire 2001 season, the 2002 season proved to be the breakout
                season for Tamika Catchings and the Fever. Catchings came out strong
                and became one of the most versatile players in the WNBA, easily
                winning Rookie of the Year honors as well as making the WNBA All-Star
                team. Her team competed well all year and would post a respectable
                16–16 record, tying for the final playoff spot with the Orlando Miracle.
                Indiana would win the tiebreaker and earn their first playoff appearance
                in franchise history. They drew the #1 seed in the playoffs, the
                Liberty; with the Fever losing two games to one.</p>

              <p>Going into the 2007 season, the Fever had their eyes set on the
                WNBA Finals. They started off the season strong, winning 16 out
                of their first 20 games, which was the best 20 game start in history
                of the Eastern Conference. Then on July 20, key player Tamika Catchings
                would injure her foot and would miss the rest of the regular season.
                The injury was later revealed as a partial tear of her plantar fascia.
                The Fever would finish 5–9 without Catchings. They managed to win
                the #2 seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs, beating out the
                Connecticut Sun. They played the same Sun team in first round of
                the playoffs. Game 1 in Connecticut was an epic battle, going three
                overtimes with the Sun hanging on to win Game 1, 93–88. The Fever
                would win Game 2 at home by double digits forcing a decisive Game
                3. In game 3, the Fever would find themselves down by 22 points
                late halfway through the 3rd quarter. The Fever battled back to
                win Game 3 in overtime by the same score as Game 1 93–88. The 22-point
                comeback was the largest comeback in WNBA Playoff history. In the
                Eastern Conference Finals, the Fever played their other hated rival,
                the Detroit Shock. The Fever would grab an early lead in the series,
                winning Game 1 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. With the team just 1
                game away from the WNBA Finals the Fever traveled to Detroit. In
                Game 2, the game would be close until the 2nd quarter, when the
                Shock would blow the game wide open with a 14–0 run, and would easily
                win the game. With a spot in the Finals up for grabs in Game 3, the
                Fever would start off the game with an early 17–3 lead. Then late
                in the first half Catchings went down with another injury; she had
                completely torn her Achilles tendon. The Shock ended up winning Game
                3, 85–61.</p>

							<p>On October 26, 2007, the Fever announced that they declined the
                option for head coach Brian Winters, ending his four-year tenure in
                charge. He compiled a 78–58 regular season record with a 5–7 playoff
                record. On December 12, 2007 assistant coach Lin Dunn was named his
                successor to the job as head coach. In one of the biggest trades in
                WNBA history, the Fever traded Tamika Whitmore and their first-round
                pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft for Indianapolis native, Katie Douglas
                on February 19, 2008. The Fever were part of the Liberty Outdoor
                Classic, which was the first regular-season professional basketball
                game played outdoors. It was played between the Fever and New York
                Liberty at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, New York on July 19,
                2008 with the Fever winning the game, 71–55. During the 2008 season,
                the Fever struggled in comparison to the three previous seasons.
                They finished with a 17–17 record, good for fourth place in the playoffs.
                Meeting the Detroit Shock in the first round, the Fever lost in
                three games.</p>

              <p>After a disappointing 2008 season, the Fever were looking to improve
                in 2009. Indiana Pacers owners had said the Fever have been losing
                money. The only thing to save the Fever from folding in the near
                future, the owners inferred, was for the Fever to be successful on
                the court and at the box office. The Fever took the owners' ultimatum
                to heart and reached the playoffs as the first seed overall in the
                Eastern Conference with a franchise best record of 22–12. In the
                first round, the Fever ousted the Washington Mystics in a sweep,
                marking their return to the conference finals. In the East finals,
                again facing their rival Detroit Shock, they reached their first
                ever WNBA Finals by defeating the Shock in three games. The Fever
                then lost in 5 games to the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA Finals.
                Because of the success in 2009, the Fever announced they would
                remain in Indianapolis for 2010. Their 2011 season in Indianapolis
                was also confirmed as well. In 2012, the Fever advanced to the 2012
                WNBA Finals. Indiana then defeated the Minnesota Lynx, 3 games to 1.
                It was the Fever's first WNBA title.</p>

              <p>After the Fever won the 2012 WNBA championship, the ownership group
                took notice of their management – by promoting general manager Kelly
                Krauskopf to president of the franchise. Krauskopf has been giving
                additional duites within the franchise as well as a pay increase.
                The Fever competed for another title in 2015, reaching the finals
                for the third time in franchise history, but fell short losing to
                the Minnesota Lynx in five games. In 2016, the Fever made it to the
                playoffs for the 12th consecutive time (the current WNBA record for
                most consecutive playoff appearances by a team). However, the Fever
                were upset in the first round elimination game against the Phoenix
                Mercury after the league's new playoff format was in effect. This
                game also marked the final game of Tamika Catchings's playing career;
                she had been known as the Fever's franchise player since 2002.</p>

              <p>On November 18, 2016, it was announced that the Fever hired Pokey
                Chatman as their new head coach. In February 2017, the Fever traded
                for five-time all-star Candice Dupree along with the Mercury's 2017
                first round pick in a three-team deal that sent Camille Little and
                Jillian Alleyne to the Mercury and the Connecticut Sun receiving
                the 8th overall pick in the 2017 WNBA Draft along with Lynetta Kizer
                from the Fever.[10] Despite acquiring a veteran all-star forward
                and a new head coach, the Fever would have one of the most disappointing
                seasons in franchise history. On August 12, 2017, the Fever were
                defeated 111-52 by the Minnesota Lynx, marking it the largest margin
                of defeat in WNBA history, in which they allowed a league record
                37-0 scoring run during the game. The Fever finished with the second
                worst record in the league of 9–25 in their first season after Catchings's
                retirement, ending their streak of 12 consecutive playoff seasons.
                In 2018, more disappointment would continue for the Fever as they
                continued to rebuild their team. They would finish in last place,
                this time with a 6–28 record. They would wind up with the third
                selection in the 2019 WNBA draft, selecting Teaira McCowan from
                Mississippi State. The 2019 season saw some improvement, but the
                team nonetheless finished 13–21, two games behind the last playoff
                spot. After the season, coach and general manager Pokey Chatman was
                fired. Near the end of the 2019 season, the Fever announced that
                they would move their home games to Butler University's Hinkle Fieldhouse
                for the 2020 and 2021 seasons, plus at least part of the 2022 season,
                to accommodate renovations of Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The team
                plans to return to Bankers Life Fieldhouse upon project completion.</p>
