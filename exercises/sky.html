					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Chicago Sky are an American professional basketball team based
              in Chicago, playing in the Eastern Conference of the Women's National
              Basketball Association (WNBA). The franchise was founded before the
              2006 WNBA season began. It is owned by Michael J. Alter (principal owner)
              and Margaret Stender (minority owner). The team experienced a period
              of success from 2013 to 2016, making four playoff appearances and
              playing in the 2014 WNBA Finals.</p>

              <p>Unlike many other WNBA teams, the Sky is not affiliated with a
                National Basketball Association (NBA) counterpart, although the
                Chicago Bulls play in the same market.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>In February 2005, NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that Chicago
                had been awarded a new WNBA franchise. The franchise was temporarily
                named WNBA Chicago. On May 27, 2005, former NBA player and coach
                Dave Cowens was announced as the team's first head coach and general
                manager. The team home would be the UIC Pavilion. The team name
                and logo formally debuted on September 20, 2005, at the Adler Planetarium.
                Team President and CEO Margaret Stender claimed the team colors
                of yellow and blue represent "[a] beautiful day in Chicago between
                the blue sky and bright sunlight to highlight the spectacular skyline."
                The team's introduction in Chicago was highlighted by the appearance
                of several star players, including former Rookies of the Year Diana
                Taurasi, Temeka Johnson, and Sue Bird and 2003 WNBA Champion Ruth Riley.</p>

              <p>In November 2005, the team held an expansion draft to help build
                its roster of players. Among the notable selections were Brooke
                Wyckoff from the Connecticut Sun, Bernadette Ngoyisa from the San
                Antonio Silver Stars, Elaine Powell from the Detroit Shock and
                Stacey Dales (who had retired prior to the 2005 season) from the
                Washington Mystics.</p>

							 <p>On February 28, 2006, the team announced that two of the minority
                 shareholders of the team are Michelle Williams, from the vocal
                 group Destiny's Child, and Mathew Knowles, father of Destiny's
                 Child lead singer Beyoncé Knowles.</p>

                <p>In their first season, the Sky achieved a 5–29 record and finished
                  last in the Eastern Conference. After the season, Dave Cowens
                  resigned from the Sky to join the coaching staff of the Detroit
                  Pistons. University of Missouri-Kansas City women's head basketball
                  coach Bo Overton was named the Sky's new head coach and general
                  manager on December 12, 2006. The Sky recorded a league-worst 5–29
                  record in 2006. Despite having the highest odds of drawing the first
                  pick in the 2007 WNBA draft lottery, the Sky ended up with the
                  third overall pick, which they used to select Armintie Price.
                  They would get the first pick in the dispersal draft of the Charlotte
                  Sting, which they used to select Monique Currie.</p>

                <p>The Sky hired Amber Stocks as head coach and general manager
                  on December 6, 2016. During the 2016–17 offseason, in what was
                  called one of the biggest trades in league history, the Sky traded
                  Delle Donne to the Washington Mystics, receiving Kahleah Copper,
                  Stefanie Dolson, and the Mystics' #2 overall pick in the 2017 WNBA
                  draft. The Sky then missed the playoffs for the first time in five
                  years in the 2017 season, posting a 12–22 record. In the ensuing
                  2018 WNBA draft, they selected Diamond DeShields and Gabby Williams
                  in the first round. The Sky missed the playoffs for a second consecutive
                  season in the 2018 season. On August 31, 2018, the Sky relieved
                  Stocks as head coach and general manager.</p>

                <p>In November 2018, the Sky hired James Wade as the team's new head
                  coach and general manager. In the 2019 WNBA draft, the Sky drafted
                  Katie Lou Samuelson, Chloe Jackson, and María Conde. Prior to
                  the season, they signed Kayla Alexander and traded away Alaina
                  Coates. The 2019 season would be a turnaround for the Sky, and
                  they finished with a 20–14 record and entered the playoffs as
                  a fifth seed. Wade received the WNBA Coach of the Year Award for
                  the regular season, and Courtney Vandersloot exceeded her own
                  assists-per-game record for the second straight season. Vandersloot,
                  Allie Quigley, and Diamond DeShields were all named All-Stars, and
                  DeShields won the All-Star Game Skills Challenge. In the playoffs,
                  defeated the Phoenix Mercury in the first round, but then lost
                  to the Las Vegas Aces on the road on a buzzer-beater in the final
                  seconds.</p>
