					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The Connecticut Sun are an American professional basketball team
              based in Uncasville, Connecticut that competes in the Eastern Conference
              of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Along with
              the Minnesota Lynx, the club was established in 1999 as part of the
              league's expansion from ten to twelve teams. The Miracle, the club's
              previous moniker, originated that year in Orlando, Florida, as the
              sister team to the NBA's Orlando Magic. Financial straits left the
              Miracle teetering on the brink of disbanding before the Mohegan Indian
              tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun, becoming the
              first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise.
              The derivative of the club's name comes from its affiliation with
              Mohegan Sun, while the team's logo is reflective of a modern interpretation
              of an ancient Mohegan symbol.</p>

              <p>Capitalizing on the popularity of women's basketball in the state,
                as a result of the success of the UConn Huskies, the Sun also held
                the distinction of being the only WNBA franchise not to share its
                market with an NBA team from 2003 until the Seattle SuperSonics
                relocated, leaving the Storm as an independent team in Seattle.
                The Sun has qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in eight of its fourteen
                years in Connecticut.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>Before the franchise relocated to Connecticut in 2003, the team
                operated as the Orlando Miracle. The Miracle played their home games
                at TD Waterhouse Centre in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team of
                the Orlando Magic. After the 2002 season, the NBA sold off all of
                the WNBA franchises to the operators of the respective teams, which
                placed the league in the middle of team contractions, relocations,
                and potential labor strife. Since Magic ownership was no longer
                interested in retaining the rights to the Miracle and no local
                partnership was reached, the organization ceased operations and
                was purchased by the Mohegan Tribe. On January 28, 2003, it was
                announced that the Miracle would immediately move to Uncasville,
                Connecticut and change its nickname to the Sun (in reference to
                the Mohegan Sun casino). The Sun's nickname, color scheme and logo
                are similar to that of another defunct Florida-based franchise,
                the Miami Sol, which folded at the same time as the Miracle's
                relocation to Connecticut.</p>

              <p>On November 20, 2012, Mike Thibault was relieved of his duties as
                head coach for the franchise. While at the helm, he amassed a 206–134
                record en route to 8 playoff appearances, four Eastern Conference
                titles and reaching the WNBA Finals twice in his ten-year tenure.
                However, Thibault's squads have had the notoriety for failing to
                flip their proverbial switch to close games; honing a burgeoning
                reputation for folding under pressure. This dubious distinction,
                coupled with the failure of achieving a franchise-first championship,
                led to the coach's dismissal. With an eye to accomplishing the
                objective of a WNBA title, the team hired Hall of Famer, Anne Donovan,
                as Thibault's successor. Among other WNBA stints, Donovan was the
                head coach of the '04 Seattle Storm team that captured the league
                title over, ironically, the Sun. Donovan hired Catherine Proto and
                Jennifer Gillom as her assistant coaches for her initial season.
                In 2014, Proto became Scouting and Video Operations Manager for
                the Sun and Steven Key replaced her as an assistant coach. During
                Anne Donovan's run as head coach she had gone 38-64 in three seasons
                with the Connecticut Sun before resigning as the head coach in 2015.
                Curt Miller would be named head coach of the Connecticut Sun starting
                in the 2016 WNBA Season.</p>

							 <p>With Curt Miller at the helm of the Connecticut Sun moves had
                 to be made in the off-season to show early signs of improvement.
                 Elizabeth Williams was sent to the Atlanta Dream for the 2016
                 fourth overall pick in Rachel Banham. In April 2016 the Sun traded
                 Chelsea Gray to the Los Angeles Sparks along with two second round
                 picks in the 2016 WNBA Draft and a 2017 first round pick for Jonquel
                 Jones and the Sparks second round selection in the 2016 WNBA Draft.
                 In the 2016 WNBA Draft, the Connecticut Sun selected Morgan Tuck
                 with their third overall draft pick. After getting three wins in
                 sixteen games on the 2016 season, the Sun moved Kelsey Bone to
                 the Phoenix Mercury for Courtney Williams and a second round draft
                 selection in the 2017 WNBA Draft. Closing out the 2016 WNBA Season
                 the sun would win eleven out of the remaining twenty games finishing
                 with a record of 14-20 missing out on the postseason by three wins.
                 In February of 2017, the Sun would trade Camille Little to the Phoenix
                 Mercury for Lynetta Kizer from the Indiana Fever and eighth overall
                 draft selection Brionna Jones in the 2017 WNBA Draft from a three
                 team trade. Ahead of the 2017 WNBA Season, Chiney Ogwumike was
                 suspended due to an injury she suffered overseas causing her to
                 miss the 2017 WNBA Season. It would only take a 1-5 record in the
                 month of May to turn the early start of the season around for Connecticut
                 finishing with 6-2 and 7-2 record in June, July, and August to clinch
                 a playoff spot. The Sun would finish the season going 21-13 just
                 one win short of tying the New York Liberty for the Eastern Conference
                 Regular Season Title. With the recent changes in 2016 to the playoff
                 format, Connecticut got a bye to the second round of the WNBA Playoffs
                 against the Phoenix Mercury. The Sun went on to lose their second
                 round game 88-83 and despite that loss more success was soon to
                 come. Chiney returned to action in the 2018 WNBA Season while
                 Stricklen resigned for another run with the Connecticut Sun.</p>

               <p>The Sun play in the Mohegan Sun Arena. Mohegan Sun is owned by
                 the Mohegan tribe. The arena is located at Mohegan Sun Casino in
                 Uncasville, Connecticut. Despite the inclusion of “Connecticut”
                 in the name, as Native American tribes are sovereign entities,
                 and as the Mohegan Sun Arena is located on the Mohegan reservation,
                 the team technically isn’t under the jurisdiction of the State of
                 Connecticut, although the team is still considered to be located
                 in Connecticut, just not under the state government’s jurisdiction.
                 Mohegan Sun Arena is smaller than most other WNBA arenas, with
                 the maximum capacity (lower and upper levels) for a basketball
                 game being 9,323. The Sun is one of the only top-level professional
                 sports franchises located in the state of Connecticut, along with
                 the New England Black Wolves of the National Lacrosse League,
                 which are also owned by the Mohegan Tribe and also play at the
                 Mohegan Sun Arena, and the Connecticut Whale of the National Women's
                 Hockey League, which are located in Danbury.</p>
