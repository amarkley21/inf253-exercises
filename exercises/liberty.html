					<h2>Intro</h2>
						<p>The New York Liberty are an American professional basketball team
              based in the New York metropolitan area, playing in the Eastern Conference
              in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The team was
              founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the
              league. The team is owned by Joe Tsai, the majority owner of the
              Brooklyn Nets. The team's home games are played at Barclays Center
              in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

              <p>The Liberty have qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in fourteen of
                its twenty-four years. The franchise has been home to many well-known
                players such as Teresa Weatherspoon, Rebecca Lobo, Becky Hammon,
                Leilani Mitchell, Essence Carson, Cappie Pondexter, and Tina Charles.
                Through the 2016 season, the Liberty have four conference championships
                and have played in the WNBA Finals four times, falling to the Houston
                Comets in 1997, 1999, and 2000, and losing to the Los Angeles Sparks
                in 2002. They have the most appearances in the WNBA Finals without
                a championship.</p>

						<h2>Franchise History</h2>
							<p>Prior to the team's first season, to avoid potential trademark
                infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct
                Liberty Basketball Association. When the WNBA opened in 1997, the
                Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they
                signed college superstar Rebecca Lobo (UConn) to a contract. Lobo
                was a starter for two seasons but was injured in 1999, and her
                injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later.
                Point guard Teresa Weatherspoon emerged as a star and the Liberty
                made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the
                Houston Comets. In 1999, they added Crystal Robinson with the 6th
                overall pick[3] and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again
                faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot
                at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the
                series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game
                of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight
                time.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded Becky
                Hammon to the San Antonio Silver Stars for Jessica Davenport, a
                first round pick in the 2007 WNBA Draft. They also acquired center
                Janel McCarville through the dispersal draft associated with the
                dissolution of the Charlotte Sting. The 2007 Liberty started out
                5–0, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the
                season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last
                4 games, beating the Washington Mystics on the tiebreaker of head-to-head
                record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge
                underdogs, faced the defending champion Detroit Shock in a best-of-three
                series. The Liberty defeated the Shock by winning Game 1 in New York.
                In Games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit,
                76–73 and 71–70 (OT) respectively.</p>

							 <p>In 2008, the Liberty drafted former Rutgers shooting guard Essence
                 Carson and former North Carolina forward Erlana Larkins, and signed
                 former Utah point guard Leilani Mitchell during the preseason. Despite
                 having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed
                 to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the Connecticut
                 Sun in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two
                 points of defeating the Detroit Shock in the third and last game
                 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed
                 a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away
                 in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the "Liberty Outdoor
                 Classic", the first ever professional regular season basketball game
                 to be played outdoors, on July 19 at Arthur Ashe Stadium of the USTA
                 Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The Indiana Fever defeated
                 the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.</p>

              <p>On May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as Team President overseeing
                all business and basketball operations of the franchise. Under Thomas'
                leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by Bill Laimbeer
                as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference
                during the 2015 season. On August 2, 2015, during halftime at the
                game against the Seattle Storm, the New York Liberty inducted WNBA
                legend Becky Hammon into the Liberty's Ring of Honor. Thomas presented
                Hammon with her ring during the induction ceremony at Madison Square
                Garden. Hammon, a former New York Liberty point guard, is currently
                an NBA assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs. After qualifying
                for the 2016 WNBA Playoffs, the Liberty lost to the Phoenix Mercury
                in the second round. In November 2017, the Madison Square Garden
                Company and James L. Dolan announced they were actively looking to
                sell the franchise. After not immediately finding a buyer, MSG relocated
                most of the Liberty's 2018 home games to Westchester County Center
                in nearby White Plains, New York, the home of MSG's NBA G League
                team the Westchester Knicks, while still continuing to pursue a sale.</p>

              <p>On January 23, 2019, the Liberty were sold to Joseph Tsai, co-founder
                of the Alibaba Group, a Chinese internet company, who then owned
                49% of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. During the 2019 season, the Liberty
                played two games in Brooklyn at the Nets' home of the Barclays
                Center, with the rest still in White Plains. Later that year, Tsai
                became the sole owner of the Nets and the Barclays Center. For the
                2020 season, Tsai relocated the Liberty to Brooklyn on a full-time
                basis. The Liberty were major players in the 2020 WNBA draft, entering
                that draft with three first-round picks plus two in the early second
                round. Shortly before the draft, they traded former league MVP
                Tina Charles to the Washington Mystics in a deal that also involved
                the Dallas Wings. They chose Sabrina Ionescu as the first pick,
                with Megan Walker and Jazmine Jones selected later in that round.
                The team also introduced a new logo, featuring a simplified version
                of their Statue of Liberty branding. The color black was also made
                one of the primary colors, echoing the aesthetic of their NBA brother
                squad, the Brooklyn Nets. The Liberty began the 2020 season, held
                in a "bubble" in Bradenton, Florida due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
                with seven rookies on their opening-night roster. The team suffered
                a major blow in their third game, in which Ionescu suffered a severe
                ankle sprain that ultimately ended her season. The Liberty ended
                the season with a league-worst 2–20 record.</p>
